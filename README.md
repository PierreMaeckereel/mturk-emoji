mturk-emoji
===========

Python + JavaScript workaround for mturk's rejection of CSV files with
Emoji.

Use Case
--------

You want to upload a CSV HIT file to Mechanical Turk that contains
Emoji characters, and have Mechanical Turk render the Emoji in an HTML
HIT template.  But as of early 2018, Amazon's Mechanical Turk service
rejects CSV HIT files that contain 4-byte UTF-8 characters - such as
Emoji.

Mechanical Turk rejects CSV files with Emoji characters with messages
with the format:

    Errors
    Line 55: Unsupported character found: ðŸ˜€
    Line 226: Unsupported character found: ðŸ˜±

Implemented Solution
--------------------

This repository contains Python code in
[encode_emoji.py](encode_emojiy.py) for converting all 4-byte UTF-8
characters into HTML spans with the 4 bytes stored as JSON data.
Sample usage:

``` python
>>> import codecs
>>> from encode_emoji import replace_emoji_characters
>>> grin_emoji = codecs.open('grin_emoji.txt', encoding='utf-8').read().strip()
>>> replace_emoji_characters(grin_emoji)
u"<span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 152, 128]'></span>"
>>> 
```

The repository also contains JavaScript code in
[decode_emoji.js](decode_emoji.js) that finds all HTML spans created
by [encode_emoji.py](encode_emoji.py) and inserts the Emoji character
into the span, so that this tag:

``` html
<span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 152, 128]'></span>
```

is replaced with:

``` html
<span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 152, 128]'>ðŸ˜€</span>
```

which is just rendered as the original Emoji:

``` html
ðŸ˜€
```

Please note that this JavaScript code depends on the jQuery library.
Sample usage:

``` html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.js"
        integrity="sha256-2Kok7MbOyxpgUVvAk/HJ2jigOSYS2auK4Pfzbm7uH60="
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="decode_emoji.js"></script>

<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('span.emoji-bytes').each(displayEmoji);
});
</script>
```
